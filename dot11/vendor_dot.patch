Subject: [PATCH 1/3] wifi: Increase 5 GHz network signal tolerance

On devices with cellular data available, I've been experiencing Wi-Fi
dropouts on 5 GHz networks where it disconnects and falls back to
cellular data around a RSSI of -77 dBm. While the Wi-Fi quality may not
be ideal at this signal level, it is still better to stay on it than
switch to cellular data because switching networks can be very
disruptive to the user.

To make matters worse, the signal tends to oscillate around -77 dBm in
my case, which causes it to oscillate between Wi-Fi and cellular data
every few seconds. This causes far more disruptions than staying on weak
Wi-Fi would.

These signal levels were measured empirically on a Pixel 5, but they
should apply to most devices. 2.4 GHz values were found to be more or
less accurate, but 5 GHz networks continued to work past the AOSP
thresholds. The iPhone 6s was also content with these signal levels and
still displayed 2 of 3 signal levels at -77 dBm.

Subject: [PATCH 2/3] BoardConfigQcom: Allow target to override as a QSSI
 supported platform

With 4.19 kernel upgrade, SDM660 platform switched to use external display-intf
repository for display headers while retaining most of backward compatibility
with older kernels.

In order to anticipate more platforms, especially msm8937 and msm8953, when 4.19
kernel support is fully baked, introduce `TARGET_OVERRIDE_QSSI_SUPPORTED_PLATFORM'
board flag to allow devices that receive 4.19 kernel upgrade with compatible HALs
to opt into using display-intf headers.
